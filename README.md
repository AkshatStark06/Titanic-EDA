# Titanic-EDA
This project performs an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on the renowned Titanic dataset. The primary goal is to uncover patterns and relationships within the data to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival during the disaster.

The analysis covers:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Handling missing values in 'Age', 'Embarked', and 'Cabin' columns.
Univariate Analysis: Examining distributions of individual features like 'Age', 'Fare', 'Pclass', 'Sex', and 'Embarked'.
Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis: Investigating the relationship between various features and the 'Survived' target variable, including interactions between multiple variables.
Feature Engineering: Creating new, informative features such as 'FamilySize', 'IsAlone', and 'Title' from existing data.
Correlation Analysis: Visualizing correlations between numerical features to identify strong relationships.
Key insights gained include the significant impact of 'Sex', 'Pclass', and 'Age' on survival rates, with women and children, as well as first-class passengers, having higher probabilities of survival.
